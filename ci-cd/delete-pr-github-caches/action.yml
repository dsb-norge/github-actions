name: 'Delete GitHub caches created from a PR branch'
description: |
  This action deletes all GitHub caches created from a PR branch.
  This is to force deletion of caches overriding default cache eviction policy.
  Due to branch scope restrictions of GitHub caches, caches created from a non-default branch are not available
  from other branches, so we might as well delete them when the PR branch is merged to ensure default branch is
  not thrashing.

  This action will fail if not called from a 'pull_request' event with 'closed' action.
