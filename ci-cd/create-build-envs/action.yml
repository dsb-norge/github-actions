name: 'Create common DSB CI/CD variables'
description: |
  Given the required input this action returns common DSB build environment variables with values.
  Common DSB build environment variables are the values needed to successfully build and deploy an app in DSB's infrastructure.
  Some variables are slightly different if the build was triggered from a PR. This is to support PR builds and deployments.
  Where possible values from input 'app-vars' are preferred.

  github-dependencies-cache-enabled:
    description: |
      Whether to enable GitHub actions cache for dependencies.
      When this is enabled the dependencies directory is emptied before each build and a caching strategy using GitHub actions cache is applied.
      In short the strategy is:
        - For the builds of the default branch:
          - A unique cache is created for each unique combination of runner OS, month of year and dependencies file (hash of pom/lock file(s)).
          - If a unique cache exist, use it. A new cache is not created after successful build.
          - If a unique cache does not exist, ignore the build dependencies file and fall back to using the previous cache based off of unique
            combination of runner OS and month of year. A new cache is created after successful build, taking into account the build dependencies
            file.
          - If no cache exists for the current month of year, create a new cache. I.e. full re-download of dependencies the first build each
            month of the year. This is to avoid the cache from growing uncontrolled. A new cache is created after the first successful build,
            taking into account runner OS, month of year and the build dependencies file.
        - For the builds of non-default branches:
          - Caches from the default branch are available to feature branches.
          - A unique cache is created for each unique combination of runner OS, pull request number and dependencies file (hash of pom/lock
            file(s)).
          - If a unique cache exist, use it. A new cache is not created after successful build.
          - If a unique cache does not exist, ignore the build dependencies file and fall back to using the previous cache based off of unique
            combination of runner OS and pull request number. A new cache is created after successful build, taking into account the build
            dependencies file.
          - If no cache exists for the current pull request number, fall back to using the latest available cache from the default branch. I.e.
            when dependencies in a feature branch diverges from those of the default branch and a unique cache does not exist for the feature
            branch, a new cache is created for the feature branch based off of the latest cache from the default branch.
          - Caches from feature branches are not available to other branches. Therefore caches of feature branches are deleted upon merge of
            the feature branch. This behavior can be changed by setting 'github-dependencies-cache-delete-on-pr-close' to 'false'
    required: false
    default: 'true'
  github-dependencies-cache-delete-on-pr-close:
    description: |
      Whether to delete the associated GitHub actions cache for dependencies when a PR is closed.
      Due to cache isolation, caches from non-default branches are not available from other branches in the repo.
      See https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/caching-dependencies-to-speed-up-workflows#restrictions-for-accessing-a-cache
      Set this to true to clean up on a faster cadence (than the default eviction policy) so as to ensure default branch is not thrashing.

      NOTE:
        `actions:write` permission is required to delete GitHub caches

      Leaving this empty causes the use of default value, which will vary depending on the 'application-type' field:
        - For maven application types (ex. 'spring-boot' and 'maven-library') this typically becomes "${HOME}/.m2/repository".
        - For node application types (ex. 'vue') this typically becomes "${HOME}/.npm".
